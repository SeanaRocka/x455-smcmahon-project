            <h4>Crochet In Photography</h4>
            <h2>Crochet Photography by Pietro Henricky</h2>
          
            <h4>Riego de la Branchardière</h4> 
            The photography of 
            <a href="https://www.pexels.com/photo/28508094/" target="_blank">Pietro Henricky</a> 
              
            is reviewed this week by the Mother of Crochet herself, Riego de la Branchardière. Henricky is a fashion photographer who has often worked with crochet artists and celebrates diversity. Henricky's photography strikes a beautiful balance between masculinity and feminity. In addition to taking beautiful fashion photograhy, Henricky is also a producer and film maker and creative Director. He currently lives and works in Fortaleza, Ceará, Brasil. He started taking photographs while spending time with his family, and was excited when he was able to turn his passion into a career. It has always been important to Henricky that he enjoys what he is doing, and he embraces the flaws in his photography and process. He enjoys shooting fashion (and we are excited that in this vein, he often photographs crochet and yarn textiles!) Henricky likes to photograph a variety of subjects, and often tries to tell his own story in his work.
          </p>
          <p>
            Though his fashion photography is amongst his favorite, he also explores other subjects. Personal histories and the effects that we reverberate with are amongst his most common themes in his work currently. The careful development of these ideas can be seen across his work. He is a proponent of artists creating work through a long and thoughtful creative process. He always says "Just get back to your process, making your work." You can see that this principle has guided his work throughout his career. <a href="./articles.html">(Read More...)</a>

            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tom_Daley" target="_blank">Thomas Robert Daley</a>
            (born 21 May 1994) is an English retired diver, YouTuber and television personality. He won the silver medal in the men's synchronized 10-metre at the 2024 Olympics, making him the first British diver to win 5 Olympic medals.
            </p>
            <p class="w3-italic">
        Tom, how old were you when you learned to knit and crochet? Who taught you? Which one attracted you first?
        </p>
        <p class="w3-margin-left">
          I started knitting 5 years ago (March 2020.) It was something I started to learn on a trip to Canada from a YouTube video. I was absolutely awful at first, I couldn't get the hang of it. One of the Australian divers and one of the Russian divers on that trip helped me while we were there and then on the flight home, one of our coaches on the British team gave me some tips and then with a lot of practice I started getting the hang of it. I only started to crochet in August 2020.
        </p>
        <p class="w3-italic">
        Do you prefer knitting or crocheting, or do you love both?
        </p>
        <p class="w3-margin-left">
        I honestly love both but for different reasons. I love knitting because I think it looks the best when finished, but I love the fact that with crochet it is so much easier to create and adjust sizes and shapes as you go.
        </p>

        What was your very first project? Can you describe it?

            <h4>Patterns in Review, Fall Themed Suit</h4>
            <h2>Not Your Average Granny Square</h2>
            <h4>Lena Skvagerson</h4> 
            <p>When I say the following two words, what comes to mind? Granny Squares. Do you think fondly of your time learning to crochet from your dear Granny Gran Gran, making these adorable squares that you can basically construct anything out of? (Think of them as the replicators of yarn.) Or does it make you smell that musty old blanket that was on the basement couch when you were growing up? Perhaps a faint smell of wet dog and microwave french fries? Or maybe it reminds of you of going through your Auntie's stuff before that big garage sale, and the smell of mothballs and cigarettes assault's your nose...
            </p>
            <p>
            Whatever your association, there are some fabulous new suits this season featuring granny squares fabricated from yarn, as well as the images of granny squares printed as textiles. Granny Gran Gran would be so impressed with where crochet has gone since she was a little fledgling. Gone are the days of shamefully hiding your crochet tuxedo, as yarn has taken a step into the bougie spotlight, as the craft of fame and prosperity.
            </p>

            <p>
            Take for instance this beautiful seventies fall themed granny square suit. This ensemble includes a jacket, slacks, and a tie, all matching in this fabulous granny square pattern. Did I hear Grany Gran Gran swoon from the grave? Yes, I did. Orange, yellow and brown come together to create the hellish nightmare couch from your dreams... No wait, they actually come together in a beatiful way in this crisp autumn suit straight out your mom's glory days. Think woodstock and hippies meet FASHION!! <a href="./articles.html">(Read More...)</a>

            <h4>Roberta Smith</h4> 
            <p>
              The hills are alive with the sound of crochet, or so the saying goes. Have you ever been moving along through your day, when all of a sudden you spot some little yarn surprise. Its like the elves and fairies have droppeds some yarn magic in your path? Whether it is just a little crochet flower, or a full blown yarn bomed fence or tree, it is always inspiring.
            </p>
            <p>
              Roberta Smith, acclaimed art reviewer and author, whose work is often featured in the New York Times takes you through some of the yarn bomb artistry from around the world that she finds to be the most inspiring. From buroughs of New York to underground yarn art from Paris, your eyes will be delighted and your fingers inspired by the photography and evidence of beautiful yarn love that is spread through the yarn bombing movement. <a href="./articles.html">(Read More...)</a>

                      While crocheting out in the world is fun, it is important to be prepared. Have all of your supplies, and also to pay attention to your own safety. Some people may think that you are weird (or knitting.) They are probably ready to learn about be seduced by the allure of Crochet in all its whimsy and glory. If someone says, I only like poetry for guys, Brochet can be their gateway into crafts!!

                        This TEDTalk is from Textile artist Magda Sayeg, who transforms urban landscapes into her own playground by decorating everyday objects with colorful knit and crochet works. These warm, fuzzy "yarn bombs" started small, with stop sign poles and fire hydrants in Sayeg's hometown, but soon people found a connection to the craft and spread it across the world. "We all live in this fast-paced, digital world, but we still crave and desire something that's relatable," Sayeg says. "Hidden power can be found in the most unassuming places, and we all possess skills that are just waiting to be discovered."

                        Community implies inclusion. Our community is fully inclusive of everyone. All types, abilities, shapes, sizes and colors are welcome here. We are all welcome to express, view, participate, not participate and enjoy. Our audience is our community and vice verse. Our intent is to explore crochet as a topic. Our point of view is slightly fashion, but also slightly crafty. The design intent of this website is to be minimalistic in terms of color palette and design, which should fully support the maximalisism in terms of subject and imagery. There has been a great deal of restraint applied in terms of minimalizing the design so that the subject can step forward. The subject should be at the focus (thank you Bauhaus.) So quickly though this has digressed into a deeper statement about artistic intent, and less about our community.

                        Do you love cute stuff? Do you like tiny things that fit in your hand? (which is what amigurumi is) <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amigurumi" target="_blank"> Amigurumi, </a>which literally translates to "crocheted or knitted stuffed toy" is the Japanese art of knitting or crocheting small, stuffed yarn creatures. I originally learned to crochet as a child, but hadn't done it in adulthood until the lockdown for the pandemic. My grandmother was good at making things, and I loved the idea that I could create things for my niece and nephew and other friends who are family. Take a peek at our patterns section for pics of things I have made through the years.

                        Do you make things with yarn or crafts or fashion or some interection between these things? Do you not make thing with yarn or craft, but you are interested or like viewing yarn and craft stuff? Please take the opportunity to make an account and join our community, where you can post photos, patterns or anything that you desire related to yarn, crafts, arts, rainbows, polka dots, glyphs, amigurumi, swiss style, the bauhaus art movement and/or constructivisim, art, gay pride or hella cute stuff.

                        Think of the Brochet and Friends community like it is social media, but less technofacisty or evil, and more yarn and inclusion focused. Joining is free, and posting just requires the creation of the free account (and for the "olds" in the audience, yes we do remember when lamebook and the rest lamies did when they originally launched, promising to be inclusive, peope centered, but seriously we promise not to be evil and stay connected to the yarn community through love and rainbows). Gosh these scrolling areas are getting pretty existential and deep, but what else are you supposed to do when the feature is required in a class, and though learning how to add it and move it around and stuff has been useful, for cereals I just mentioned minimalism and bauhaus. This 3rd column is so extra and though I full heartedly have included it in this assignment, if it were in a real design it would be used maybe slightly less. Just figuring out how to have my web design skills meet my graphic design aesthetic.
